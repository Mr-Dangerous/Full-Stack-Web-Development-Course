    Starforce Tactics is my first foray into the world of programming games and websites.
    I'll share all of my progress here as well as give you some sneak peeks at the game.
    This website is going to change a lot!

    <h3>Game Development Progress</h>
      Currently, I am on my fourth iteration of the game in Gamemaker Studio 2.
      <br>
      As of now, there is currently a functioning battleground in which you can
      spawn ships to battle against each other!  Soon, the game will have a card game element that
      determines what ships you spawn.
